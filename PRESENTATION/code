\begin{frame}{SPECTRUM REQUIREMENTS OF 5G-IoT}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\justifying

\item A combination of low-band, mid-band and high band spectrum is desirable to manage the use cases of 5G enable IoT successfully as suggested by 5G America.

\item Using a combination of different bands help to address certain use cases better than others.

\item Apart from the generalized spectrum requirements, a new air interface called New Radio (NR) is defined by 3GPP for 5G. Its specification falls into two categories.

\item Firstly, FR1, which refers to spectrum below 6GHz. Here, FCC has provided two licensed spectrums for 5G deployment.
\vspace{1em}\\ 1) Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) operating at 3.55 – 3.7GHz. 
\vspace{1em}\\2) C-band operating at 3.70 – 4.2GHz, respectively. Others possible spectrum ranges suggested by FCC are 6-7 GHz band (5.925-6.425 GHz and 6.425-7.125 GHz) which are unused and can support wider bandwidths than its predecessor (LTE). 

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

5G-IoT}
\begin{frame}{FEATURES EMPLOYED IN PHY LAYER TO SUPPORT
5G-IoT}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\justifying

\item MIMO, CoMP, and the HetNets, etc. are some of the features that have been standardized for LTE/LTE Advanced (LTE-A) technology. 

\item These technologies show encouraging results in providing massive connectivity and high data-rate. Therefore, 5G technology employs these concepts. 

\item These concepts are discussed at first to get their insight in the next sub-sections.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{MASSIVE-MIMO (M-MIMO)}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\justifying

\item The MIMO(Multi Input Multi Output) technology is considered a necessary part of LTE-A and is based on the concept of spatial multiplexing. Data streams from multiple antennas are multiplexed and are transmitted over a variety of spatially separated channels.

\item M-MIMO is an integral part of the 5G infrastructure. At mmWave, many antenna elements are needed so that highly directional narrow beam can be produced to counteract the path-loss. 

\item This technique becomes feasible to implement the high-order multi-user MIMO (MUMIMO) to enhance the small cell capacity. In 5G radio access network (RAN), is based on M-MIMO in ‘‘macroassisted small cells’’.

\item M-MIMO allows the possibility of distributed MIMO, where multiple narrow beams simultaneously get transmitted to the same mobile station from the BS(Base Stations) at a different location to improve throughput and reduce the correlation among the antenna elements. 

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{COORDINATED MULTIPOINT PROCESSING (CoMP)}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\justifying

\item CoMP transmission in downlink and reception in uplink is a very effective way to enhance the cell-edge user throughput. CoMP utilizes distributed MIMO for transmission and reception from different antennas, which may not belong to the same cell to reduce, received spatial interference and enhanced the received signal quality. 

\item CoMP is a very effective technique if deployed using MU-MIMO to increase cell edge coverage and reduce the outages caused by blocking and channel conditions.

\item At mmWave, the study was carried out at 73GHz in an urban micro-cell environment for BS diversity in CoMP style manner. The CoMP is a transceiver technique, by which the interference issues can be lessened. This is done by coordinating the transmission and reception between the spatially distributed BSs using the channel state information.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS (HetNets)}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\justifying

\item The HetNets supports the ‘‘green’’ aspect of 5G by maximizing the spectral efficiency through reusing the spectrum tightly and with low uplink and downlink power transmission making it spectrum and energyefficient. 

\item Sharing the spectrum by the massive number of user equipment – an ultra-dense network (UDN) requires an intelligent interference mitigation technique. In order to cater for the interference, the HetNets uses enhanced inter cell interference coordination (e-ICIC) and further enhanced ICIC (feICIC).

\item These features allow it to handle massive traffic and large node density; hence; making it suitable for satisfying the requirements of service-driven 5G enabled IoT.

\begin{frame}{CAN 5G FIND BAL BTW CONNECTIVITY AND SECURITY?}
    

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\justifying

\item The arbitrary connection of cellular phone devices to the network, gives rise to security related issues such as interception of data flowing in a network and incorporation of unauthorized codes to unofficially control the network services.

\item This exchange of data among devices, with the assistance of coexisting technologies, requires security at almost each relay node or a BS in order to sustain the security of the network services.

\item The implementation of secure boot and reliable execution environment contributes to the security of intelligent devices which protects them from illegal involvement of other devices.

\item An amalgamation of intelligent system and security of software will not only strengthen the safe communication of interconnected IoT devices, but also motivates the novel approaches for upcoming wireless communication networks.

\begin{frame}{IS 5G FLEXIBLE ENOUGH FOR DIFF TYPES OF NET CONFIG?}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\justifying

\item The traffic generated by such IoTs is different from that generated by cellular systems in many aspects. First, unlike the case of broadband access, most IoT traffic is in the uplink. 

\item IoT networks’ messages are typically small in size and sparse in time. Furthermore, IoT devices are limited in energy and computation resources.

\item These IoT devices’ characteristics make their access to 5G systems different from classical cellular devices. Identifying the right system parameter configuration for the specific IoT use case is a big challenge.

\setlength\itemsep{1em}
\justifying

\item In 5G technology, one million devices could be connected over 0.38 mi2, whereas in 4G, only two thousand devices can be connected.

\item This extensive coverage would significantly drain the battery of devices. The intelligent 5G-IoT network constitutes narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) that is required for effective energy utilization and it contributes to considerably lower-power communication.

\item Thus, an intelligent 5G-IoT environment will assure the capability to process huge volume of data with minimal latency, reliability, and sustained accessibility of the network services. 

\item For effective management and handling of devices, 
the requirement of intelligence for IoT-based devices is essential especially when huge traffic is formed by all connected elements via Internet.
